      <center> Your quick thinking saved your life! After you climb the tree you see the animal at the bottom circling you, it is a tiger. The tiger sees it cannot reach you and eventually leaves. After about 10 minutes, you climb back down the tree. You make your way through the jungle and escape the tall grass. You're at a fork in the road. The left are rapids, the right is a dirt path. Where do you go?
