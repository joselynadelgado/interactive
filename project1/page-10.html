      <center> You decide to throw your flashlight at the bats hoping it will scare them away. Instead, it falls back to the ground and breaks. You can't see a thing and the bats are swarming around you, knocking into you, and bitting you all over. You walk backwards and fall into a pit. You break most of your bones. You are in pain. You die.
