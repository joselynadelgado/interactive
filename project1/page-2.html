    <p>
      <center> You get to the top of the hill and can see lots of the island.  From a distance there appears to be a boat in the ocean, a few miles away. You wave your flashlight but they don't notice since you are far away. It will be dark soon and you consider on spending the night in a nearby cave. Should you swim to boat? Or you head for the cave?
