      <center> You get to the top of the hill and can see lots of the island.  From a distance there appears to be a boat in the ocean, a few miles away. You wave your flashlight but they don't notice since you are far away. It will be dark soon, but you might be able to get pretty close to the boat before then. You also consider just spending the night in a nearby cave. Should you swim to the boat? Or you head for the cave?
