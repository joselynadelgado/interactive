    <p>
      <center> You decide to tell the crocodile a joke. "Why don’t crocodiles like fast food?" The croc looks confused and asks "why?" to which you reply "because they can’t catch it!" <br> ... <br> The croc is not amused. You think how that was probably not the best joke to make but before you can redeem yourself he swallows you whole. You die.
