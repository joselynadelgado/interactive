      <center> You decide to play it safe and take the dirt road path, or so you thought. You notice your legs getting heavy and your pace slowing down. You look down and see your feet have been swallowed by the ground. Youâ€™re walking through quicksand! You try to push yourself up but your hands get submerged. You take one last breath before your head is swallowed by the sand.
        You die.
