    <p>
      <center> You think about singing a song and the first one that comes to mind is Crocodile Rock by Elton John. You sing "We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock" and the croc looks pleased. You continue the chorus and then you hear more voices chime in. You look around and see more crocodiles. They are your backup singers. They sing "Laa, la-la-la-la-laa, La-la-la-la-laa, La-la-la-la-laa". What the hell is in this swamp water? Anyways, you finish the song and all the crocs look happy. They love Elton John. They yell encore but thats the only crocodile song you know. So you sing it over and over again. Forever.
