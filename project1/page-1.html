    <p>
     <center> You wake up and find yourself stranded on a deserted island. Were you shipwrecked? You're on the beach, the sun is shining in your face. You look around and notice you are alone. Your phone is dead, but you have a working flashlight. You need to get off the island. To the left is a tall hill, you might be able to see the whole island from the top. To the right is a jungle, who knows what you'll find in there. Where do you go? </center>
