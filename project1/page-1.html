     You wake up and find yourself stranded on a deserted island. Shipwrecked? You're on the beach, the sun is shining in your face.  You look around and notice you are alone. Your phone is dead, but you have a working flashlight and a flare gun. You need to get off the island.  To the left is a hill, to the right is a jungle, where do you go?
