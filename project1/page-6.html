      <center> You remember the wise words of Beyonce "to the left to the left everythihng you own in the box to the left" and decide thats the way to go. You walk for about 5 minutes before you hear some squeaking... from above. You point your flashlight up to see about 100 bats staring at you. You don't think and just scream. This makes the bats angry and they fly toward you. What do you do?
