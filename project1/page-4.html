    <div class="box">

    <p>
      <center> You get to the edge of the cave. The inside is dark, but its starting to get dark outside too. You consider starting a fire by the cave, the smoke could or could not signal in your favor. Do you stay the night in the cave? Or do you go back to the beach to try and make a shelter out of sticks/drywood?
