    <p>
      <center> You head to the woods to gather materials to make a fire for the cave. Once back at the cave, you get cozy by the fire and your eyes start to get heavy. The only problem is something else wants to get cozy by the fire. You are too tired to hear a tiger sneak up on you. Did I mention the tiger hasn't eaten in 3 days? The tiger eats you. You die.
