    <h1 > The City in the Sea </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter1"> Lo! Death has reared himself a throne </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter2"> In a strange city lying alone </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter3"> Far down within the dim West, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter4"> Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter5"> Have gone to their eternal rest. </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter6"> There shrines and palaces and towers </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter7"> (Time-eaten towers and tremble not!) </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter8"> Resemble nothing that is ours. </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter9"> Around, by lifting winds forgot, </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter10"> Resignedly beneath the sky </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter11"> The melancholy waters lie. </p>
     
     
     <br>
     <br>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter2"> No rays from the holy Heaven come down </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter3"> On the long night-time of that town; </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter4"> But light from out the lurid sea </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter5"> Streams up the turrets silently—  </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter6"> Gleams up the pinnacles far and free— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter7"> Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter8"> Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter9"> Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter10"> Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter11"> Up many and many a marvellous shrine </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter12"> Whose wreathed friezes intertwine </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter13"> The viol, the violet, and the vine. </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter14"> Resignedly beneath the sky </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter15"> The melancholy waters lie. </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter16"> So blend the turrets and shadows there </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter17"> That all seem pendulous in air, </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter18"> While from a proud tower in the town </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter19"> Death looks gigantically down. </p>


 <br>
 <br>

<p class="line anim-typewriter3"> There open fanes and gaping graves </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter4"> Yawn level with the luminous waves; </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter5"> But not the riches there that lie </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter6"> In each idol’s diamond eye— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter7"> Not the gaily-jewelled dead </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter8"> Tempt the waters from their bed; </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter9"> For no ripples curl, alas! </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter10"> Along that wilderness of glass— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter11"> No swellings tell that winds may be </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter12"> Upon some far-off happier sea— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter13"> No heavings hint that winds have been </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter14"> On seas less hideously serene. </p>


     <br>
     <br>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter4"> But lo, a stir is in the air! </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter5"> The wave—there is a movement there! </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter6"> As if the towers had thrust aside, </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter7"> In slightly sinking, the dull tide— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter8"> As if their tops had feebly given </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter9"> A void within the filmy Heaven. </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter10"> The waves have now a redder glow—</p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter11"> The hours are breathing faint and low— </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter12"> And when, amid no earthly moans, </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter13"> Down, down that town shall settle hence, </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter14"> Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, </p>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter15"> Shall do it reverence. </p>
