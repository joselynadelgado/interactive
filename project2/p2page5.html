      I. <br>
      Hear the sledges with the bells—<br>
                 Silver bells!<br>
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!<br>
        How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,<br>
           In the icy air of night!<br>
        While the stars that oversprinkle<br>
        All the heavens, seem to twinkle<br>
           With a crystalline delight;<br>
         Keeping time, time, time,<br>
         In a sort of Runic rhyme,<br>
To the tintinabulation that so musically wells<br>
       From the bells, bells, bells, bells,<br>
               Bells, bells, bells—<br>
  From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.<br> </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter2">     
      II.<br>
      Hear the mellow wedding bells,<br>
                 Golden bells!<br>
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!<br>
        Through the balmy air of night<br>
        How they ring out their delight!<br>
           From the molten-golden notes,<br>
               And all in tune,<br>
           What a liquid ditty floats<br>
    To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats<br>
               On the moon!<br>
         Oh, from out the sounding cells,<br>
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!<br>
               How it swells!<br>
               How it dwells<br>
           On the Future! how it tells<br>
           Of the rapture that impels<br>
         To the swinging and the ringing<br>
           Of the bells, bells, bells,<br>
         Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,<br>
               Bells, bells, bells—<br>
  To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!</p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter3">  
      III.<br>
      Hear the loud alarum bells—<br>
                 Brazen bells!<br>
What tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!<br>
       In the startled ear of night<br>
       How they scream out their affright!<br>
         Too much horrified to speak,<br>
         They can only shriek, shriek,<br>
                  Out of tune,<br>
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,<br>
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,<br>
            Leaping higher, higher, higher,<br>
            With a desperate desire,<br>
         And a resolute endeavor<br>
         Now—now to sit or never,<br>
       By the side of the pale-faced moon.<br>
            Oh, the bells, bells, bells!<br>
            What a tale their terror tells<br>
                  Of Despair!<br>
                  How they clang, and clash, and roar!<br>
       What a horror they outpour<br>
On the bosom of the palpitating air!<br>
       Yet the ear it fully knows,<br>
            By the twanging,<br>
            And the clanging,<br>
         How the danger ebbs and flows;<br>
       Yet the ear distinctly tells,<br>
            In the jangling,<br>
            And the wrangling.<br>
       How the danger sinks and swells,<br>
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells—<br>
             Of the bells—<br>
     Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,<br>
            Bells, bells, bells—<br>
 In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!<br>
              </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter4"> 
     IV. <br>
      Hear the tolling of the bells—<br>
                 Iron bells!<br>
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!<br>
        In the silence of the night,<br>
        How we shiver with affright<br>
  At the melancholy menace of their tone!<br>
        For every sound that floats<br>
        From the rust within their throats<br>
                 Is a groan.<br>
        And the people—ah, the people—<br>
       They that dwell up in the steeple,<br>
                 All alone,<br>
        And who tolling, tolling, tolling,<br>
          In that muffled monotone,<br>
         Feel a glory in so rolling<br>
          On the human heart a stone—<br>
     They are neither man nor woman—<br>
     They are neither brute nor human—<br>
              They are Ghouls:<br>
              And their king it is who tolls;<br>
        And he rolls, rolls, rolls,<br>
                    Rolls<br>
             A pæan from the bells!<br>
          And his merry bosom swells<br>
             With the pæan of the bells!<br>
          And he dances, and he yells;<br>
          Keeping time, time, time,<br>
          In a sort of Runic rhyme,<br>
             To the pæan of the bells—<br>
               Of the bells:<br>
          Keeping time, time, time,<br>
          In a sort of Runic rhyme,<br>
            To the throbbing of the bells—<br>
          Of the bells, bells, bells—<br>
            To the sobbing of the bells;<br>
          Keeping time, time, time,<br>
            As he knells, knells, knells,<br>
          In a happy Runic rhyme,<br>
            To the rolling of the bells—<br>
            Of the bells, bells, bells—<br>
            To the tolling of the bells,<br>
      Of the bells, bells, bells, bells—<br>
              Bells, bells, bells—<br>
  To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.<br>
