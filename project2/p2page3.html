    <h1 > The Haunted Palace </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter1"> In the greenest of our valleys </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter3"> By good angels tenanted, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter7"> Once a fair and stately palace— </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter9"> Radiant palace—reared its head. </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter11"> In the monarch Thought’s dominion, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter15"> It stood there! </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter17"> Never seraph spread a pinion </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter19"> Over fabric half so fair! </p>
     
     
     <br>
     <br>

     
      <p class="line anim-typewriter2"> Banners yellow, glorious, golden, </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter4"> On its roof did float and flow </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter5"> (This—all this—was in the olden </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter8"> Time long ago) </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter10"> And every gentle air that dallied, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter12"> In that sweet day, </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter16"> Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter18"> A wingèd odor went away. </p>


     <br>
     <br>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter3"> Wanderers in that happy valley, </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter5"> Through two luminous windows, saw </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter7"> Spirits moving musically </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter9"> To a lute’s well-tunèd law, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter13"> Round about a throne where, sitting, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter15"> Porphyrogene! </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter17"> In state his glory well befitting, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter20"> The ruler of the realm was seen. </p>

     <br>
     <br>

<p class="line anim-typewriter2"> And all with pearl and ruby glowing </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter4"> Was the fair palace door, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter6"> Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter8"> And sparkling evermore, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter11"> A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter13"> Was but to sing, </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter18"> In voices of surpassing beauty, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter19"> The wit and wisdom of their king. </p>

     <br>
     <br>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter3"> But evil things, in robes of sorrow, </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter6"> Assailed the monarch’s high estate; </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter7"> (Ah, let us mourn!—for never morrow </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter9"> Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter11"> And round about his home the glory </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter13"> That blushed and bloomed </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter16"> Is but a dim-remembered story </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter19"> Of the old time entombed. </p>

     <br>
     <br>

     <p class="line anim-typewriter4"> And travellers, now, within that valley, </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter7"> Through the red-litten windows see </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter9"> Vast forms that move fantastically </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter11"> To a discordant melody; </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter14"> While, like a ghastly rapid river, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter15"> Through the pale door </p>
    
     <p class="line anim-typewriter18"> A hideous throng rush out forever, </p>
     
     <p class="line anim-typewriter20"> And laugh—but smile no more. </p>

     <br>
